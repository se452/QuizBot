        Welcome to this video about artificial intelligence. Today we'll discuss the basics of machine learning,
        neural networks, and how AI is transforming various industries. Machine learning is a subset of AI that
        focuses on building systems that learn from data. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, consist
        of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that can recognize patterns in data. Deep learning is a
        subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers. AI applications include natural
        language processing, computer vision, and autonomous vehicles. Ethical considerations in AI development
        include bias, privacy, and job displacement. The future of AI looks promising with advancements in
        quantum computing and neuromorphic hardware.
